### Hi 👋, I'm Esra

I am a passionate individual in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. Since my high school years, I have continuously honed my skills in project development and content creation within these domains. To share my passion and knowledge with a broader audience, I write and share accessible content on topics related to data science and artificial intelligence.

Additionally, I aim to increase digital awareness among children by writing educational materials and storybooks focused on robotics. My goal is to help children explore technology in a fun and engaging way.
